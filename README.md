# AddMvc4ToWebForms-nuget-package
## Integrate MVC4 to existing ASP.NET WebForms project using nuget package manager

I've worked on several projects those are built with ASP.NET Webforms Application. Now ASP.NET MVC has brought so many feature, so it's a better option. So, recently I tried to convert one of my ASP.NET WebForms project to MVC, but there are many features which might get broken. Hence I tried to mix things up, I mean integrated MVC to my WebForms application, so that I don't have to change my existing works.

And then I build this small nuget package to integrate MVC4 to your existing ASP.NET WebForms application.
